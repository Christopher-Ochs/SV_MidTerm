SV_MidTerm

Things we need to accomplish in this project.
1. A mechanism to send e-mails to people on the infected users contact lists
    - this will contain a phising link that when clicked on will infect that user
2. A mechanism to run a file on download
3. Some infection mechanic that will mess with the user's computer but not too badly. 
    - maybe just open a bunch of windows and make it hard to navigate around the users computer.
